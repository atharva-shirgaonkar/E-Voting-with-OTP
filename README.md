## How the system works
Administrator is required to have created candidates. 
Before creating candidates, the admin must have created positions
After doing this, the voters can vote (provided that they are registered and verified)

## How do voters get verified ?
OTP is sent to voter's phone. In a case of OTP delivery error, voter can request for OTP again. 
The OTP is sent via an SMS gateway. 
Voters can request for OTP for a maximum of three times.
Same OTP is sent to voters

## Can OTP verification be bypassed ?
Yeah, sure.
Open `settings.py` and toggle `SEND_OTP` to  `False`
Then, wait till server restarts

## Having any issue using this ?
